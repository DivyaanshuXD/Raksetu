const userData = userDoc.data();

if (userData?.partnershipStatus?.active) {

  const benefits = userData.partnershipStatus.benefits;
  
  // Grant partner-specific access
  if (tier === 'Healthcare Partner') {

  allow update: if get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
  
  // Only admins can delete
  allow delete: if get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}

match /users/{userId} {
  // Users can update their own profile, admins can update any profile
  allow update: if request.auth.uid == userId || 
                get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
