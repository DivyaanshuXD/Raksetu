## üéØ How to Use

### **Method 1: Admin Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Open Raksetu at http://localhost:5173
2. Sign in (any user can access Admin Section)
3. Navigate to **Admin Section**
4. Look for **4th stats card** labeled "Database Seeder"
5. Click **"Open Seeder Panel"** button
6. Review stats:
   - 21 Blood Banks
   - 10 Cities
   - 10 States
   - Categories breakdown
7. Click **"üå± Seed Blood Banks Now"** button
8. Wait 5-10 seconds
9. ‚úÖ Success message: "Successfully seeded 21 blood banks!"

### **Result:**
Firebase now has 21 realistic blood banks with:
- All metadata (name, address, phone, email)
- GPS coordinates (for distance calculations)
- Realistic inventory for all 8 blood types
- Blood components inventory
- Complete facility information

## üìä Realistic Inventory Patterns

### **Time-Based Fluctuations:**

**Morning (6 AM - 6 PM):**
- Full inventory (donation camps happen)
- O+ blood: 60-80 units

**Evening (6 PM - 12 AM):**
- 30% lower (surgeries deplete stock)
- O+ blood: 42-56 units

**Weekend Effect:**
- 20% lower on Saturdays/Sundays
- Fewer donation camps on weekends

**Blood Type Rarity Distribution:**
- **O+ (most common):** 40-80 units
- **O- (universal donor):** 10-30 units
- **A+:** 30-60 units
- **A-:** 5-20 units
- **B+:** 25-55 units
- **B-:** 3-15 units
- **AB+:** 15-35 units
- **AB- (rarest):** 2-10 units

## üöÄ Why This Solves the Problem

### **The e-Raktakosh API Blocker:**
- ‚ùå Requires organization PAN card
- ‚ùå User only has personal PAN
- ‚ùå API approval takes 4-8 weeks
- ‚ùå Can't launch without real blood bank data

### **The Mock Data Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Launch immediately (4-6 weeks to MVP)
- ‚úÖ $0/month Firebase cost
- ‚úÖ Realistic demo experience
- ‚úÖ All features work end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Path to manual blood bank onboarding
- ‚úÖ Scalable organic growth
- ‚úÖ API becomes optional, not essential

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### **Mock Data Approach:**
- **Firebase Reads:** ~500/day (inventory checks)
- **Firebase Writes:** ~10/day (manual updates)
- **Monthly Cost:** **$0** (within free tier)

### **Web Scraping Approach** (Not Chosen):
- **Firebase Reads:** ~5,000/day
- **Firebase Writes:** ~800/day
- **Monthly Cost:** $15-25/month at 1k users, $150-250/month at 10k users
- **Legal risks, maintenance burden, stale data**

### **Winner:** Mock data + manual onboarding = **$0/month forever!** üéâ
